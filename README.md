# Project Description
This project is a web application that allows users to view information about random users and obtain weather data based on their locations. It utilizes two different APIs for this purpose - one for fetching random user data and another for retrieving weather data.

Key Features
- View Random Users: The website enables users to browse random users using an API that provides random demographic information such as name, gender, location, etc.
- View Weather by Location: Users can see weather conditions based on the location of each random user, utilizing an API that provides weather data based on geographic coordinates.
Technologies
- React: The website is built using the React library, enabling the creation of fast and efficient user interfaces.
- APIs: The project utilizes two distinct APIs for fetching random user data and weather data, respectively.
